Question 1:
Clean the room function: 
given an input of [1,2,4,591,392,391,2,5,10,2,1,1,1,20,20], make a function that organizes these into individual array that is ordered. 
For example answer(ArrayFromAbove) should return: [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2], 4,5,10,[20,20], 391, 392,591].

Bonus: Make it so it organizes strings differently from number types. i.e. [1, "2", "3", 2] should return [[1,2], ["2", "3"]]

Question 2: 
Write a javascript function that takes an array of numbers and a target number. The function should find two different numbers in the array that, when added together, give the target number. For example: answer([1,2,3], 4)should return [1,3]

Question 3: Write a function that converts HEX to RGB. Then Make that function auto-dect the formats so that if you enter HEX color format it returns RGB and if you enter RGB color format it returns HEX.

Question 4: Create an object ( calculator ) with three methods:
1. read() prompts for two values and saves them as object properties.
2. sum() returns the sum of saved values.
3. mul() multiplies saved values and returns the result.

Question 5: Create a constructor function Accumulator(startingValue). 
Object that it creates should: 
1. Store the “current value” in the property value. 
2. The starting value is set to the argument of the constructor startingValue. 
The read() method should use prompt to read a new number and add it to value. 
In other words, the value property is the sum of all user-entered values with the initial value startingValue.

Question 6: Write a function that: Asks the user for values using prompt and stores the values in the array.
Finishes asking when the user enters a non-numeric value, an empty string, or presses “Cancel”.
Calculates and returns the sum of array items.
P.S. A zero 0 is a valid number, please don’t stop the input on zero.

Qusetion 7: Write a function that changes dash-separated words like “hello-myfriends” into camel-cased “helloMyfriends”. 

Bonus: the function removes all dashes if there are more than one, each word after dash becomes uppercased.

Qusetion 8: Collect 5 questions about how to arrange data of arrays.

Qusetioin 9: Include 2 questions about how to filter unique items of an array.
