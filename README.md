Question 1:
Clean the room function: 
given an input of [1,2,4,591,392,391,2,5,10,2,1,1,1,20,20], make a function that organizes these into individual array that is ordered. 
For example answer(ArrayFromAbove) should return: [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2], 4,5,10,[20,20], 391, 392,591].

Bonus: Make it so it organizes strings differently from number types. i.e. [1, "2", "3", 2] should return [[1,2], ["2", "3"]]

Question 2: 
Write a javascript function that takes an array of numbers and a target number. The function should find two different numbers in the array that, when added together, give the target number. For example: answer([1,2,3], 4)should return [1,3]

3. mul() multiplies saved values and returns the result.

Question 5: Create a constructor function with methods to calculate the sum values that prompts ask.

Question 7: Write a function that: Asks the user for values using prompt and stores the values in the array.
Finishes asking when the user enters a non-numeric value, an empty string, or presses “Cancel”.
Calculates and returns the sum of array items.
P.S. A zero 0 is a valid number, please don’t stop the input on zero.
